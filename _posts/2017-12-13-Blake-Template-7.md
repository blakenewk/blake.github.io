(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>Me and my partner worked well because we were alternating with the keyboard, which we also did last week. Also, wewere one of the only groups to finish the robot arm which gave us some time to play around with it.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Something that limited my learning was my group argued a bit about who was going to be doing the typing at that time. Also, on one of the topics we didn't agree on what the book was trying to say. Finally we spent too much time playing the robot arm.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the future, me and my partner need to resolve a problem a little bit quicker or just don't get into an argument inthe first place. Finally, we need to be fair to the other partner to make sure they have the same amount of time on the keyboard as the other person. The same with the robot arms.</td>
