(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I didn't meet my goal because I didn’t finish everything in the lesson, so I was very confused when I had to do it at home.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>When I was in the lesson I was focusing a lot on helping other people, which also helped me because it was forcing me to go back and relearn what I already did so I could help teach a new student about Github. Also, I was making sure I was doing everything right by going back and checking everything in the slideshow that the teacher gave us.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Something that limited my learning was focusing on other people more than I was focusing on my own work. I was also too focused on what was going on with the people that were coming in and out of the classroom. By doing that, I wasn't able to finish my work in the lesson. Finally, because I didn’t finish my work in the lesson I had to do it at home, and when I was doing at home I messed it up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the future, I will focus more on my own work and make sure mine is done before I start to help other people. Also, next time I need to make sure I don’t get distracted by every interruption in the class. When that happens nobody gets their work done. </td>
