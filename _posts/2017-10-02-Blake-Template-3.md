    <td>Something that limited my learning was we spent a few minutes too long doing one of the topics because we were having fun doing it. Also, we could have spent less time arguing about who was going to be doing the typing first.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>In the future, me and my partner need to make a resolution to the problem of us arguing about who is going to type first. Also, we need to spend less time a one subject even if we are having fun with it.</td>
