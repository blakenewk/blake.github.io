    <td>Me and my partner worked well because we were alternating with the keyboard, which we also did last week. Also, by going back through the book we were able to learn more then the other groups.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Something that limited my learning was my group argued a bit about who was going to be doing the typing at that time. Also, we were arguing on if we should go back through the book, which ended up being the right decision.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the future, me and my partner need to resolve a problem a little bit quicker or just don't get into an argument in the first place. Finally, we need to be fair to the other partner to make sure they have the same amount of time on the keyboard as the other person. The same with letting the person have a say so we hear their opinion.</td>
