(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Something that was very effective in my group was everyone was alternating on the keyboard and with the book because we had more people in the group than we were supposed to.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Something that limited my learning was the fact that we had two too many people in our group, which meant that I had less time with the book and on the keyboard. That also resulted in other boys having the same problem as me.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the future, we will not have two extra people which will help with me getting more time with the book and on the keyboard. Finally, I will try my best to move through the topics a little bit quicker.</td>
