    <td>Something that was very effective for my group was we got the same FUZE box as we had the lesson before. Also, we kept the rule that half way through the lesson we would switch who was typing.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>We got really lucky in getting the same FUZE box as we got before. Next lesson one of us need to bring in a thumb drive so that the origress we made the lesson before isn't lost.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the future, it would help to get a thumb drive to keep all of our progress. Also, we have to try to interact less with the tables next to us or else we will get distracted.</td>
