    <td>I worked very fast, and if I got stuck I was very productive and made sure to ask the person next to me for help. I got a lot done considering how long I was in the lesson for.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>There were only two things that limited my learning. To start, I got distracted once with the person next to me, and the other thing is I had to leave halfway through for a music lesson.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will not get distracted with the people next to me and luckily, the music lesson aren't on the same day as IT for the rest of the year, so I will not miss any of the lesson time.</td>
