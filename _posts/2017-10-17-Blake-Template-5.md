    <td>Something that limited my learning was my group argued a bit about who was going to be doing the typing at that time. Also, on one of the topics we didn't agree on what the book was trying to say.</td>

    <td>In the future, me and my partner need to resolve a problem a little bit quicker or just don't get into an argument inthe first place. Finally, we need to be fair to the other partner to make sure they have the same amount of time on the keyboard as the other person.</td>
