    <td>When my group of three were working, we were working really well together. Also, we decided we wanted to start again, so we restarted trying to use the booklet as least time as possible. Finally, I made sure we got it all done by staying focused on the topic the whole time.</td>

    <td>In the lesson, at the beginning of the lesson me and my partner couldn't find a book so we could get to work, which resulted in us being behind when we joined another group. Also, after turning off the computer, we were behind compared to the rest of the people, but we caught right back up.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>In the future, me and my partner will have a book so we will get more done. Also, I will remember that when we restarted, it wasnâ€™t the best idea, so I will definitely not do that again. Finally, I will make sure I start my work quicker.</td>
